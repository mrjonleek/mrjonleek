I am a proud associate of the worlds largest enterprise open source company, [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com). 

In 2019 Red Hat was aqcuired by IBM to define their [Cloud & Cognitive Computing](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/redhat) portfolio.

As an Emerging Technologies Specialist I focus on customersâ€”developing a deep understanding of critical business drivers and evaluating technology solutions that support essential outcomes.

I provide hyperscaler egnostic hybrid-cloud platforms for application development, container orchestration and AI. 

Outside of work I enjoy time with family and friends and my membership as a global citizen traveling whenever and wherever possible. I also enjoy geography and history, especially as it pertains to wine. Check out some of my community projects and open source initiatives.

A few things that are important to me:

* Reduce global emissions by making IT more efficient
* Improve the lives of my fellow developers with innovative technology
* Support the smart innovators who seek to improve the world
