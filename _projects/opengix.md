description: "OpenGIX organizes complex data-imbued geometry into geospacial layers to enable interactivity in maps and graphs. As a draft-standard, the OpenGIX schema defines the API for working with layers of GeoJSON and TopoJSON documents."

Charts, graphs, maps and diagrams are some of the most exciting formats for presenting data and communicating ideas. Interactivity within these formats creates an immersive experience and a lasting impression. Most important of all however, is the data driving the substance within these medium.

Working with interactive data is challenging. The OpenGIX project provides standards and tools for working with complex geometrical data models and objects.

## About OpenGIX

GIX is an intialism of geometrical interpolation and transformationâ€”fancy words that suggest usage and function in that geometry can be imbued with artibrary data points and serialized into approachable, easy to use layers.

### Schema

The [OpenGIX schema](https://github.com/OpenGIX/schema) defines how layers are structured establishing a standard API for implementation in editors, browers and applications.

### OpenGIX Editor

The [OpenGIX](https://github.com/OpenGIX/vscode-extension) editor is a Visual Studio Code extension for working with OpenGIX documents.

The project aimes to limit functionality to a few necessary capabilities by including visualization tools for editing geographical spaces and properties.
